# simulated data
 
 The scripts and data for simulation T1 were downloaded from http://genoweb.toulouse.inra.fr/~alegarra/GOBLUP/.

 Then, T2 data was generated by modifying the above scripts. 


## Data processing

Calculation of the kinship matrices was done with the script: `data_prep.R` (note the commented lines must be run one time to generate the K matrix).

## Analyses

The following scripts run the analyses:
-`univariate.R`
-`sce1_c2021.R`
-`sce2_c2021.R`
-`sce3_c2021.R`
-`FSBULP.R`

These can be parallelized on a cluster using the `*.sh` files.

Note that the file path should change to your workpath.

Results can be collected and figures made with `Figures.R`.

The manuscript results are save in `results` directory.
